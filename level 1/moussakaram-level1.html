<p>When we are faced with difficult times as we are now with the effects of a worldwide
 pandemic, it is easy to get discouraged and lose hope.  Hope is a vital component
 of human existence, and it is needed to find happiness and peace during times that
  might otherwise lead us to be discouraged.  As Andrew Carnegie so clearly pointed out,
   setting a goal can keep your thoughts focused, direct your energy, and inspire the hope
    that is needed to move through and beyond a moment of despair.

    <i>liberates your energy and inspires your hopes.</i></q>
